## Alighieri, Dante <a name="alighieri">
"This beast, the cause of your complaint, lets no one pass her way&mdash;but harries all to death. Her nature is so malign and vicious she cannot appease her voracity, for feeding makes her hungrier."  
**_Il Inferno_ Canto I (c. 1300)**  

## Asimov, Isaac <a name="asimov">
"If I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words. I think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God, God, God, and whose every deed is foul, foul, foul.  
I would also want a God who would not allow a Hell. Infinite torture can only be a punishment for infinite evil, and I don't believe that infinite evil can be said to exist even in the case of Hitler. Besides, if most human governments are civilized enough to try to eliminate torture and outlaw cruel and unusual punishments, can we expect anything less of an all-merciful God?  
I feel that if there were an afterlife, punishment for evil would be reasonable and of a fixed term. And I feel that the longest and worst punishment should be reserved for those who slandered God by inventing Hell"  
**_I, Asimov: A Memoir_ (1994)**  
  
"I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have. Somehow, it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic. I finally decided that I'm a creature of emotion as well as of reason. Emotionally, I am an atheist. I don't have the evidence to prove that God doesn't exist, but I so strongly suspect he doesn't that I don't want to waste my time."  
**_Free Inquiry_ (1982)**
  
"There are many aspects of the universe that still cannot be explained satisfactorily by science; but ignorance only implies ignorance that may someday be conquered. To surrender to ignorance and call it God has always been premature, and it remains premature today."  
**_The "Threat" Of Creationism_ (1981)**  
  
"People are entirely too disbelieving of coincidence."  
**_The Planet That Wasn't_ (1975)**  
  
## Baldwin, James <a name="baldwin">
"One writes out of one thing only&mdash;one's own experience. Everything depends on how relentlessly one forces from the experience the last drop, sweet or bitter, it can possibly give."  
**_Notes of a Native Son_ (1955)**
  
"Hatred, which could destroy so much, never failed to destroy the man who hated and this was an immutable law."  
**_Notes of a Native Son_ (1955)**
  
## Coates, Ta-Nehisi <a name="coates">
"I was only beginning to learn to be wary of my own humanity, of my own hurt and anger&mdash;I didn't yet realize that the boot on your neck is just as likely to make you delusional as it is to ennoble."  
**_Between the World and Me_ (2015)**  

## Dick, Phillip K. <a name="dick">
"Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away."  
**_How to Build a Universe That Doesn't Fall Apart Two Days Later_ (1978)**  

## Einstein, Albert <a name="einstein">
"Science, in consequence, has been accused of undermining morals—but wrongly. The ethical behavior of man is better based on sympathy, education and social relationships, and requires no support from religion. Man's plight would, indeed, be sad if he had to be kept in order through fear of punishment and hope of rewards after death."  
**_Religion and Science_ (1930)**  

"To punish me for my contempt of authority, Fate has made me an authority myself."  
**_Aphorism for a friend_ (18 September, 1930)**    

## Guthrie, Woody <a name="guthrie">
"This song is Copyrighted in U.S., under Seal of Copyright #154085, for a period of 28 years, and anybody caught singin' it without our permission, will be mighty good friends of ours, cause we don't give a darn. Publish it. Write it. Sing it. Swing to it. Yodel it. We wrote it, that's all we wanted to do."  
**_Letter to Fans_ (c. 1930s)**  

"As I went walking I saw a sign there  
And on the sign it said 'No Trespassing.'  
But on the other side it didn't say nothing,  
That side was made for you and me."  
**_This Land Is Your Land_ (1940)**  

## Hitchens, Christopher <a name="hitchens">
"What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence."  
**_God Is Not Great_ (2007)**  

## Holt, Jim <a name="holt">
**"A Quick Proof That There Must Be Something Rather Than Nothing, for Modern People Who Lead Busy Lives**  
"Suppose there were nothing. Then there would be no laws; for laws, after all, are something. If there were no laws, then everything would be permitted. If everything were permitted, then nothing would be forbidden. So if there were nothing, then nothing would be forbidden. Thus nothing is self-foridding. Therefore, there must be something. QED."  
**_Why Does the World Exist?: An Existential Detective Story_ (2012)**  
  
## King Jr., Martin Luther <a name="mlk">
"The tough mind is sharp and penetrating, breaking through the crust of legends and myths and sifting the true from the false. The tough-minded individual is astute and discerning. He has a strong austere quality that makes for firmness of purpose and solidness of commitment. Who doubts that this toughness is one of man's greatest needs? Rarely do we find men who willingly engage in hard, solid thinking. There is an almost universal quest for easy answers and half-baked solutions. Nothing pains some people more than having to think."  
**_Strength to Love_ (1963)**   
  
"We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed."  
**_[Letter From A Birmingham Jail](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html)_ (1963)**  
  
"Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured."  
**_[Letter From A Birmingham Jail](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html)_ (1963)**  
    
"[I] must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: 'I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action'; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a 'more convenient season.' Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection."  
**_[Letter From A Birmingham Jail](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html)_ (1963)**  
  
"Men often hate each other because they fear each other; they fear each other because they don't know each other; they don't know each other because they can not communicate; they can not communicate because they are separated."  
**_Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story_ (1958)**   
  
## Orwell, George <a name="orwell">
"The enemy is the gramophone mind, whether or not one agrees with the record that is being played at the moment."  
**_Unused preface to Animal Farm_ (c. 1945)**  

"[T]he whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought[.] In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that can ever be needed, will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten."  
**_Nineteen Eighty-Four_ (1948)**  

"Thoughtcrime does not entail death, thoughtcrime IS death."   
**_Nineteen Eighty-Four_ (1948)**  
  
"It is a feeling of relief, almost of pleasure, at knowing yourself at last genuinely down and out. You have talked so often of going to the dogs — and well, here are the dogs, and you have reached them, and you can stand it. It takes off a lot of anxiety."  
**_Down and Out In Paris and London_ (1933)**  
  
## Rushdie, Salman <a name="rushdie">
"I do not envy people who think they have a complete explanation of the world, for the simple reason that they are obviously wrong."  
**_Interview With David Frost_ (1993)**  
  
"The idea of the sacred is quite simply one of the most conservative notions in any culture, because it seeks to turn other ideas — uncertainty, progress, change — into crimes."  
**_Lecture at Herbert Reade Memorial_ (1990)**  
  
"It matters, it always matters, to name rubbish as rubbish ... to do otherwise is to legitimize it."  
**_"Outside The Whale" In Granta_ (1984)**  
  
  
## Russell, Bertrand <a name="russell">
"Christ said 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,' and when asked 'who is my neighbour?' went on to the parable of the Good Samaritan. If you wish to understand this parable as it was understood by his hearers, you should substitute 'German' or 'Japanese' for Samaritan. I fear many present-day Christians would resent such a substitution, because it would compel them to realize how far they have departed from the teachings of the Founder of their religion."  
**_Unpopular Essays_ (1950)**  
  
"If everything must have a cause, then God must have a cause. If there can be anything without a cause, it may just as well be the world as God, so that there cannot be any validity in that argument. It is exactly of the same nature as the Hindu's view, that the world rested upon an elephant and the elephant rested upon a tortoise; and when they said, "How about the tortoise?" the Indian said, "Suppose we change the subject." The argument is really no better than that."  
**_Why I Am Not A Christian_ (1927)**  
  
"[T]o be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness."  
**_The Conquest of Happiness_ (1930)**  
  
"[W]hen you have looked for some time steadily at the worst possibility and have said to yourself with real conviction, ‘Well, after all, that would not matter so very much’, you will find that your worry diminishes to a quite extraordinary extent.”   
**_The Conquest of Happiness_ (1930)**  
  
## Sartre, Jean-Paul <a name="sartre">
"Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does."  
 **_Being and Nothingness_ (1943)**   
  
  
## Thoreau, Henry David <a name="thoreau">
"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation."  
**_Walden_ (1854)**  
  
  
## Watterson, Bill <a name="watterson">
"In a culture that relentlessly promotes avarice and excess as the good life, a person happy doing his own work is usually considered an eccentric, if not a subversive."  
**_Some Thoughts On The Real World By One Who Glimpsed It And Fled (Kenyon College Commencement)_ (20 May, 1990)**  


## White, Ken <a name="white">
"The furnace on a steam locomotive bound for San Francisco does not have a goal of reaching San Francisco; the furnace just burns what you throw into it to move the train along."  
**_[The Allure of Unquestioned Premises: "The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz"](http://www.popehat.com/2014/08/07/the-allure-of-unquestioned-premises-the-internets-own-boy-the-story-of-aaron-swartz)_ (2014)**
